## UI Improvements Captured

### Grid Layout Improvements
✅ **Balanced Grid Systems**: Story sections now use 3-column grids instead of sparse 5-column layouts
✅ **Better Content Distribution**: More harmonious 1:2 and 2:1 content ratios replacing asymmetric layouts
✅ **Responsive Spacing**: Optimized gaps with `gap-8 lg:gap-12` for better visual hierarchy

### Typography Enhancements
✅ **Hero Heading**: Reduced from `lg:text-8xl` to `lg:text-7xl` for better proportions
✅ **Section Headings**: Changed from faint `font-light` to more readable `font-normal`
✅ **Text Contrast**: Improved muted text color from `#6b7280` to `#5a5a5a` for better accessibility

### Spacing Optimizations
✅ **Responsive Padding**: Updated from fixed `py-20` to responsive `py-16 lg:py-20`
