## Summary
Homepage HTML (~108â€¯KB) is served uncompressed with a 1-year cache (`s-maxage=31536000`), leading to slow first loads and stale content.

## Proposed Solution
1. Enable gzip or Brotli compression via Next.js or proxy.
2. Reduce HTML payload using dynamic imports and component splitting.
3. Shorten Cache-Control for HTML to ensure timely updates.

## Priority
Medium; improves performance and freshness.
