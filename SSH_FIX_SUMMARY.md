# SSH Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

Fixed the GitHub Actions workflow SSH connection failure with "Permission denied" error (exit code 5) when connecting to Hostinger VPS.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SSH Connection Testing (`.github/workflows/deploy-vps.yml`)

**Before:**
```bash
sshpass -p "..Tensorflow2022carbon@.." ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null "${VPS_USER}@${VPS_HOST}" "echo Connected to $(hostname)"
```

**After:**
- Added `VPS_PASSWORD` environment variable for secure password handling
- Enhanced SSH connection test with verbose debugging
- Added comprehensive connectivity tests (ping, port check, SSH banner)
- Multiple retry attempts with different SSH options
- Detailed error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### 2. Updated All SSH Commands

All SSH and SCP commands in the workflow now use:
- `export SSHPASS="${VPS_PASSWORD}"` for secure password handling
- `sshpass -e` instead of `sshpass -p` (more secure)
- Enhanced SSH options: `-o ConnectTimeout=30 -o PasswordAuthentication=yes`
- Proper error handling with specific error messages

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools

**SSH Test Script:** `scripts/test-ssh-connection.sh`
```bash
# Test SSH connection manually
./scripts/test-ssh-connection.sh
```

**Troubleshooting Guide:** `docs/SSH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Comprehensive troubleshooting steps
- VPS SSH configuration requirements
- Manual fix instructions

## Most Likely Root Cause

The VPS SSH daemon probably has one of these configuration issues:

1. **Password authentication disabled:**
   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no  # Should be 'yes'
   ```

2. **Root login disabled:**
   ```
   PermitRootLogin no  # Should be 'yes'
   ```

## How to Fix on VPS

1. **Login to VPS via Hostinger control panel console**

2. **Edit SSH configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

3. **Ensure these settings:**
   ```
   PasswordAuthentication yes
   PermitRootLogin yes
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   ```

4. **Restart SSH service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Manual SSH Test
```bash
# From your local machine or the repository
./scripts/test-ssh-connection.sh
```

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Workflow
- Push to `salman_14_08_25` branch
- The enhanced workflow will now provide detailed diagnostic output
- If SSH still fails, the error messages will show exactly what needs to be fixed

## Enhanced Workflow Features

1. **Comprehensive Diagnostics:**
   - Network connectivity test (ping)
   - SSH port accessibility test
   - SSH server banner detection
   - Verbose SSH debugging output

2. **Better Error Messages:**
   - Specific error descriptions
   - Exact commands to fix VPS configuration
   - Common troubleshooting steps

3. **Improved Security:**
   - Password stored in environment variable
   - No plaintext passwords in command output
   - Proper SSH connection options

## Expected Outcome

After fixing the VPS SSH configuration, the workflow should:
1. ✅ Successfully connect to the VPS
2. ✅ Upload helper scripts
3. ✅ Create backups
4. ✅ Deploy the application
5. ✅ Complete successfully

## Support

If the issue persists after following the troubleshooting guide:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed diagnostic output
2. Run the manual SSH test script for local debugging
3. Verify VPS SSH configuration via Hostinger control panel
4. Contact Hostinger support if SSH service issues persist
