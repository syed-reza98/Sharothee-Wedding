# CI/CD Pipeline Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the planned GitHub Actions workflow for the Incia & Arvin Wedding Website. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments while maintaining the stability required for a production wedding website.

## Proposed GitHub Actions Workflow

### Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml (Planned - Not Yet Implemented)
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

env:
  NODE_VERSION: '20.10.0'
  WORKING_DIRECTORY: 'client'
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Code Quality and Linting

**Purpose**: Ensure code meets project standards and conventions.

```yaml
lint-and-format:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/package-lock.json
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run ESLint
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run lint
      
    - name: Auto-fix linting issues
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run lint:fix
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent code style across contributors
- Early detection of code quality issues
- Automated fixing of common problems

#### 2. Type Checking

**Purpose**: Ensure TypeScript type safety and catch compilation errors.

```yaml
type-check:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: TypeScript type checking
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run type-check
      
    - name: Prisma client generation
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run db:generate
```

**Benefits**:
- Type safety enforcement
- Early detection of interface mismatches
- Prisma client validation

#### 3. Unit Testing

**Purpose**: Validate individual component and utility function behavior.

```yaml
unit-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      test-group: [components, utils, api]
  steps:
    - name: Run Jest unit tests
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm test -- --testPathPattern=${{ matrix.test-group }}
      
    - name: Generate coverage report
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run test:coverage
      
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/coverage
```

**Coverage Targets**:
- Components: >80%
- Utilities: >90%
- API routes: >70%

#### 4. End-to-End Testing (Smoke Tests)

**Purpose**: Validate critical user journeys work correctly.

```yaml
e2e-smoke-tests:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Install Playwright browsers
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npx playwright install chromium
      
    - name: Build application
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Run smoke tests
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run e2e:smoke
      env:
        NEXTAUTH_URL: http://localhost:3000
        NEXTAUTH_SECRET: test-secret
        DATABASE_URL: file:./test.db
```

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
- Homepage loads and navigation works
- RSVP form submission flow
- Admin login and dashboard access
- Mobile responsiveness validation

#### 5. Build Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure the application builds successfully for production.

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Production build
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Bundle size analysis
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run analyze
      
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: build-artifacts
        path: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/.next
```

**Build Validations**:
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All pages compile successfully
- Bundle size within acceptable limits
- Static asset optimization

#### 6. Security Audit

**Purpose**: Identify and address security vulnerabilities.

```yaml
security-audit:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: npm security audit
      working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
      run: npm run security:scan
      
    - name: Dependency vulnerability scan
      uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-add-sarif@v1
      with:
        sarif-file: 'security-audit.sarif'
        
    - name: CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      with:
        languages: typescript, javascript
```

**Security Checks**:
- High-severity vulnerability detection
- Dependency audit with remediation suggestions
- Static code analysis for security patterns
- Environment variable exposure validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Deployment

```yaml
deploy-staging:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  needs: [lint-and-format, type-check, unit-tests, build, security-audit]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: staging
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging server
      run: |
        # SSH deployment to staging environment
        # Automated database migrations
        # Health checks and rollback capability
```

### Production Deployment

```yaml
deploy-production:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  needs: [lint-and-format, type-check, unit-tests, e2e-smoke-tests, build, security-audit]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: production
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Hostinger VPS
      run: |
        # Coordinated deployment with blue-green strategy
        # Database migration with backup
        # Post-deployment verification
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Secrets

```yaml
# GitHub Secrets (to be configured)
secrets:
  # Production Database
  PROD_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.PROD_DATABASE_URL }}
  
  # Authentication
  PROD_NEXTAUTH_SECRET: ${{ secrets.PROD_NEXTAUTH_SECRET }}
  
  # Email Service
  PROD_RESEND_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROD_RESEND_API_KEY }}
  
  # Media Upload
  PROD_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: ${{ secrets.PROD_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME }}
  PROD_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROD_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY }}

```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
# Per-environment configuration
env:
  # Development
  DEV_DATABASE_URL: "file:./dev.db"
  DEV_NEXTAUTH_URL: "http://localhost:3000"
  
  # Staging
  STAGING_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DATABASE_URL }}
  STAGING_NEXTAUTH_URL: "https://staging.arvinwedsincia.com"
  
  # Production
  PROD_NEXTAUTH_URL: "https://arvinwedsincia.com"
```

## Quality Gates

### Mandatory Checks (Blocking)

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint passes with no errors
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript compilation succeeds
3. **Build**: Production build completes without errors
4. **Security**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
5. **Core Tests**: Critical unit tests pass

### Optional Checks (Non-blocking)

1. **Test Coverage**: Target >80% but won't block deployment
2. **Bundle Size**: Warn if significant increase
3. **Performance**: Lighthouse scores for reference
4. **E2E Tests**: Can be bypassed in emergency deployments

## Notification Strategy

### Success Notifications

```yaml
# Slack/Discord integration for successful deployments
- name: Notify success
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: success
    text: "✅ Wedding website deployed successfully to production!"
```

### Failure Notifications

```yaml
# Immediate alerts for pipeline failures
- name: Notify failure
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    text: "❌ Pipeline failed - wedding website deployment blocked!"
```
