# Copilot Session Implementation Log (Admin Auth + E2E)

Date: 2025-08-20

Repository: Sharothee-Wedding (branch: susv2)

## Overview

End-to-end hardening of the admin authentication flow, Playwright E2E automation for admin login → dashboard, and fixes for redirect loops, unit tests, and TypeScript issues. This log summarizes all changes made in this session, with rationale and how to run.

## Key Outcomes

- Admin login works reliably and redirects to dashboard without loops.
- Playwright e2e test added for admin login and wired via project config.
- Unit test expectation aligned (router.push on success).
- NEXTAUTH secret handling unified across API and middleware.
- TypeScript error fixed in admin layout.

## Files Changed / Added

### Auth & Middleware

- src/lib/auth.ts
  - Added `secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to ensure API and middleware share the same JWT secret.
  - Credentials provider continues to read `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
  - `pages.signIn` remains `/admin/login`.

- src/middleware.ts
  - Final matcher: protects admin sections while excluding `/admin/login` to avoid redirect loops.
    - `"/admin/(dashboard|guests|events|media|hotels|streams|contacts|settings)(.*)?"`
  - Note: During debugging, middleware was temporarily disabled; it’s re-enabled now with the matcher above.

### Admin UI

- src/app/admin/layout.tsx
  - Bypass chrome on login route (`/admin/login`) to prevent loops.
  - Added stable test hooks and a11y:
    - `<h1 data-testid="admin-header">` for Playwright assertion.
    - `<nav aria-label="Admin Navigation">` and `<main role="main">`.
  - TypeScript fix: `session?.user?.name || session?.user?.email` (optional chaining).

- src/app/admin/login/page.tsx
  - Successful sign-in now calls `router.push(...)` (aligns with unit test expectation).
  - Includes `callbackUrl` in `signIn` call and respects `result.url`.
  - Stabilization: after sign-in, waits briefly for a session (skipped in NODE_ENV=test) to avoid race in E2E.
  - Added `data-testid="admin-login-submit"` to the submit button for reliable selection.

### Playwright / E2E

- playwright.config.js (added)
  - `projects: [{ name: 'chromium', use: devices['Desktop Chrome'] }]`.
  - `testDir: './e2e'`, `reporter: 'line'`.
  - `webServer`: starts Next on `http://localhost:3000` with env set:
    - `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
    - `reuseExistingServer: false` to avoid stale servers.
  - Note: A `playwright.config.ts` was also created earlier; `package.json` scripts explicitly use the `.js` file.

- e2e/admin-login.spec.ts (added)
  - Navigates to `/admin/login`, fills credentials, submits.
  - Waits to leave `/admin/login`, then asserts `[data-testid="admin-header"]` is visible.
  - Uses `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` from env or defaults.

- package.json (updated)
  - scripts:
    - `e2e`: `playwright test --config=playwright.config.js --project=chromium`
    - `e2e:headed`: same with `--headed`

### Environment

- .env.local.example (already present)
  - Verified it contains guidance for `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, admin creds, and local DB.
  - Playwright server command sets these env vars for tests automatically.

## Redirect Loop: Cause & Fix

- Cause: Global NextAuth middleware matched `/admin/*`, including `/admin/login`, which redirected back to `signIn` page recursively.
- Fixes:
  1) Excluded `/admin/login` by narrowing middleware matcher to real admin sections.
  2) Admin layout now bypasses auth chrome on the login route; client-side guard handles protection elsewhere.

## Unit Test Alignment

- Test: `src/__tests__/AdminAuth.test.tsx` expects `router.push('/admin/dashboard')` after `signIn`.
- Change: Login page now uses `router.push` (not `replace`) on success.

## TypeScript Fix

- Error: `'session' is possibly 'null'` in `admin/layout.tsx`.
- Fix: Optional chaining for session reads: `session?.user?.name || session?.user?.email`.

## How to Run

- Install Playwright browsers (one-time):
  - `npx playwright install`
- Start E2E (auto-starts dev server on 3000 with required env):
  - `npm run e2e`
- Run a specific test:
  - `npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.js --project=chromium -g "Admin Login E2E"`
- Unit tests:
  - `npm test` (or `npm test --silent`)
- Type check:
  - `npm run type-check`
- Build (ensure `.env.local` exists):
  - `npm run build`

## Environment Guidance

- Local (dev):
  - `.env.local` should define:
    - `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`
    - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-dev-secret`
    - `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
    - Database vars (SQLite or MySQL per project docs)
- Production:
  - Set the same env vars in your hosting platform.
  - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your HTTPS origin and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is strong and kept secret.

## Notes & Next Steps

- If E2E fails on CI: ensure port 3000 free, envs present, and that middleware excludes `/admin/login`.
- You can re-enable stricter middleware later if needed; current matcher balances safety and test stability.
- Optional: add more E2E coverage (Guests listing, Events CRUD, Media upload) following this pattern.

## Change Log (Chronological Summary)

1. Added Playwright e2e test and config, wired npm scripts.
2. Identified redirect loop; excluded `/admin/login` in middleware; bypassed chrome on login in layout.
3. Updated login to push on success; added callbackUrl handling; added test ids.
4. Stabilized E2E with session wait post sign-in and URL check.
5. Added NextAuth secret to options and ensured env passed via Playwright server command.
6. Fixed TS optional chaining issue in admin layout.
