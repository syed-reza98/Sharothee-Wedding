# Deployment Success Report - Laravel Wedding Website

## Critical Deployment Issues - ALL RESOLVED ✅

### Issue 1: Missing .env.example File
**Problem**: Workflow failing with `cp: cannot stat '.env.example': No such file or directory`
**Solution**: Created comprehensive `.env.example` with wedding-specific configuration
```bash
# Fixed in server/.env.example
APP_NAME="Sharothee Wedding"
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
WEDDING_COUPLE_NAMES="Sharothee"
WEDDING_DATE="2024-12-25"
RSVP_DEADLINE="2024-12-15"
```

### Issue 2: Missing Public Directory
**Problem**: Laravel missing main entry point and URL routing
**Solution**: Created complete `public/` directory structure
- ✅ `public/index.php` - Laravel main entry point
- ✅ `public/.htaccess` - URL rewriting and security rules

### Issue 3: Workflow Cache Path Error
**Problem**: Incorrect Composer cache path in GitHub workflow
**Solution**: Fixed cache key to reference specific lock file location
```yaml
# Before: hashFiles('**/composer.lock')
# After:  hashFiles('server/composer.lock')
```

### Issue 4: Database Configuration
**Problem**: SQLite database file missing
**Solution**: Created `database/database.sqlite` file and verified migrations
