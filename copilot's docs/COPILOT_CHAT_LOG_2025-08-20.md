# Copilot Chat Log — 2025-08-20

Repository: Sharothee-Wedding  
Branch: v_20_08_2025

## Summary

This session focused on polishing the Home page “Our Story” section (style, color, typography, icon layout), improving face visibility and brightness for the three “Where It All Began” images, enhancing mobile responsiveness, and resolving a Next.js build error related to useSearchParams needing a Suspense boundary on the 404 route.

## Key Requests and Context

- Review and improve “Our Story” section UI/UX in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Improve image face visibility, brightness, and cropping for:
  - `Where It All Began 1.jpeg`
  - `Where It All Began 2.jpeg`
  - `Where It All Began 3.jpeg`
- Make the site more mobile-friendly for that section (tilt effects, layout).
- Fix build-time error:
  - useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/404".

## Actions Taken

1. UI/UX and Accessibility
   - Tuned color palette, typography, and icon layout to align with theme.
   - Added/kept motion-reduce guards for improved accessibility.

2. Image Visibility and Responsiveness
   - Increased main image container height in “Where It All Began”.
   - Switched to responsive object-position utilities to keep faces visible across breakpoints.
   - Adjusted scale, brightness, contrast, and saturation for better clarity.
   - Reduced overlay opacity to reveal faces while preserving aesthetic.
   - Limited tilt/transform effects to md+ screens for mobile friendliness.

3. Build Error Fix (useSearchParams + Suspense)
   - Located components using `useSearchParams`:
     - `src/components/RouteLoader.tsx` (rendered globally in `app/layout.tsx`).
     - `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`.
   - Wrapped render boundaries in Suspense:
     - `app/layout.tsx`: `<Suspense fallback={null}><RouteLoader /></Suspense>`.
     - `admin/login/page.tsx`: Refactored into `AdminLoginInner` and exported a Suspense-wrapped default component.

## Files Changed (references)

- `client/src/app/page.tsx` (prior UI/UX and image tuning)
- `client/src/app/layout.tsx` (RouteLoader wrapped in Suspense)
- `client/src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` (Suspense wrapper around inner component)

## Validation

- Type-check: Passed (`npm run type-check`).
- Lint: No blocking issues observed.
- Build: Recommended to re-run `npm run build` after environment setup; fix targets the reported 404 Suspense error.

## Next Steps

- Rebuild locally or on VPS to confirm the 404 Suspense error is resolved.
- Manually validate the “Our Story” user journey:
  - Faces remain visible on mobile/tablet/desktop.
  - Interactive hover/tilt only on md+.
  - Overlay balance preserves warmth without hiding faces.
- Optional: Audit other pages for `useSearchParams` in future additions and keep them inside Suspense.
