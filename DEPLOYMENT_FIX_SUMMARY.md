# Deployment Fix Summary - Issue #27

## Problem
The VPS deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL.
Prisma schema validation - (get-config wasm)
Error code: P1012
```

## Root Cause
The `scripts/vps/deploy.sh` script was running Prisma commands (`npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`) without loading the `.env.local` file that contains the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

The deployment workflow creates the `.env.local` file on the VPS with the correct MySQL connection string, but the deploy script wasn't reading this file before executing the Prisma commands.

## Solution
Modified `scripts/vps/deploy.sh` to:

1. **Load environment variables** from `.env.local` if it exists
2. **Export the variables** to make them available to all subsequent commands
3. **Filter out comments and empty lines** for robust parsing
4. **Use `eval` instead of `bash -lc`** to preserve environment variables in the current shell

## Changes Made
- Added environment loading logic at the beginning of `scripts/vps/deploy.sh`
- Ensured all commands (build, migration, service restart) have access to the loaded environment variables
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Made the script shellcheck compliant

## Testing
- ✅ Verified environment variables are loaded correctly from `.env.local`
- ✅ Confirmed Prisma commands receive the `DATABASE_URL` variable
- ✅ Tested with simulated deployment scenario
- ✅ Validated shellcheck compliance
- ✅ Ensured backwards compatibility with existing workflow

## Files Modified
- `scripts/vps/deploy.sh` - Added environment variable loading

## Result
The deployment will now succeed because:
1. The workflow creates `.env.local` with `DATABASE_URL="mysql://wedding_user:W3dd1ng@ArvinIncia2025!@localhost:3306/wedding_db"`
2. The deploy script loads this environment file
3. Prisma commands can access the `DATABASE_URL` variable
4. Database connection and schema migration succeed

This fix resolves the deployment failure while maintaining compatibility with the existing deployment workflow.
