## ⚠️ Performance Analysis & Recommendations

### **🔍 Issues Identified**

**1. Image Loading Problems** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: 17 out of 19 images failing to load (89% failure rate)
- **Root Cause**: URL encoding of spaces in filenames
- **Example**: `Where%20It%20All%20Began%201.jpeg` vs actual file `Where It All Began 1.jpeg`
- **Impact**: Poor visual experience, broken image placeholders

**Recommendation**: 
```bash
# Rename files to remove spaces or update image references
mv "Where It All Began 1.jpeg" "where-it-all-began-1.jpeg"
# OR update image paths in components to use proper URL encoding
```

**2. Page Content Length** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: Page height 15.8x viewport (10,562px total)
- **Impact**: Long scroll times, potential performance on slower devices
- **Recommendation**: Consider pagination or lazy-loaded sections

**3. Hydration Warnings** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: Server/client HTML mismatch warnings
- **Impact**: Console errors, potential SEO implications

### **✅ Performance Strengths**
